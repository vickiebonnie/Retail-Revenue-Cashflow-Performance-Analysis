## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the development of a management reporting framework designed to help business stakeholders monitor revenue performance, identify cashflow risks and support executive decision-making through structured KPI reporting and data visualization.

The objective was to transform operational sales and payment data into clear, actionable insights that management could use for performance monitoring and financial planning.


## Business Context

A small retail business required improved visibility into revenue performance and delayed customer payments impacting cashflow stability. Existing records provided transactional data but lacked structured reporting needed for decision-making.

This project focused on organizing financial data into a reporting format that enables management to:

- Monitor revenue trends over time

- Identify unpaid or delayed revenue

- Understand customer payment behavior

- Detect potential cashflow risks early


## Project Objectives

- Structure raw operational data into a management reporting format

- Develop key performance indicators (KPIs) for performance monitoring

- Analyze revenue trends and payment patterns

- Present insights in a format accessible to non-technical stakeholders

- Support decision-making through clear visual reporting


## Management Reporting Outputs

The reporting framework produced:

- Revenue performance KPIs

- Cashflow risk identification through unpaid revenue analysis

- Customer payment behavior insights

- Monthly revenue performance tracking

- Executive-ready dashboard for management reporting


## Tools Used

Microsoft Excel (Data Cleaning & Analysis)

Tableau (Dashboard Visualization)







## Methodology

The analysis followed a structured data analysis workflow consisting of data preparation, transformation and visualization stages.

### Data Preparation

- Consolidated sales records into a single structured dataset

- Standardized date formats to enable accurate time-based analysis

- Removed non-transaction entries and ensured each row represented a single product purchase

- Anonymized customer information by replacing names with unique Customer IDs

- Standardized product names and payment status categories for consistency

### Data Analysis

- Aggregated transaction values to measure total revenue and daily sales performance

- Analyzed product-level revenue to identify top-performing items

- Compared paid and unpaid transactions to evaluate revenue collection performance

- Calculated key performance indicators including total revenue, transaction volume and  customer count.

  ## Conclusion

The analysis shows that the shop maintains stable revenue driven by a small group of high-performing products and loyal customers. While overall collection performance remains strong, unpaid revenue presents a manageable but important cashflow risk. By improving payment monitoring and strategically promoting products, the business can strengthen revenue consistency, reduce outstanding balances and support sustainable growth.



## Recommendations

- Prioritize high-performing products such as Kalypo, Simply Good Biscuit  and Cowbell Coffee by maintaining consistent stock levels and using them to drive bundled sales.

- Improve sales of low-performing products through bundle offers, small discounts or better product placement alongside fast-moving items.

- Strengthen payment monitoring and follow-up, especially for customers with repeated unpaid purchases to reduce cashflow risk.

- Introduce simple credit control measures, such as limiting unpaid balances or encouraging immediate payment for frequent customers.

- Regularly monitor sales and payment trends to support better restocking decisions and maintain stable revenue performance.
