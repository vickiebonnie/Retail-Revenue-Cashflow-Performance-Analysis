# Retail-Revenue-Cashflow-Performance-Analysis
This project analyzes retail sales and payment behavior for a small convenience shop between November 2025 and January 2026


## Project Overview
A friend of mine owns a small neighborhood mini shop and was finding it increasingly difficult to track business performance as daily transactions increased. While sales were recorded regularly, it was not clear which products generated the most revenue, which customers purchased most frequently or how unpaid transactions were affecting cash flow.

As a result, restocking and business decisions were often based on assumptions rather than clear data insights. This project was developed to demonstrate how simple sales data can be structured and visualized to provide clarity on revenue performance, product demand and payment behavior.

The goal of the analysis is to show how data analytics can help small businesses move from intuition-based decisions to insight-driven operations.
