## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the development of a management reporting framework designed to help business stakeholders monitor revenue performance, identify cashflow risks and support executive decision-making through structured KPI reporting and data visualization.

The objective was to transform operational sales and payment data into clear, actionable insights that management could use for performance monitoring and financial planning.


## Business Context

A small retail business required improved visibility into revenue performance and delayed customer payments impacting cashflow stability. Existing records provided transactional data but lacked structured reporting needed for decision-making.

This project focused on organizing financial data into a reporting format that enables management to:

- Monitor revenue trends over time

- Identify unpaid or delayed revenue

- Understand customer payment behavior

- Detect potential cashflow risks early


## Project Objectives

- Structure raw operational data into a management reporting format

- Develop key performance indicators (KPIs) for performance monitoring

- Analyze revenue trends and payment patterns

- Present insights in a format accessible to non-technical stakeholders

- Support decision-making through clear visual reporting


## Management Reporting Outputs

The reporting framework produced:

- Revenue performance KPIs

- Cashflow risk identification through unpaid revenue analysis

- Customer payment behavior insights

- Monthly revenue performance tracking

- Executive-ready dashboard for management reporting

The dashboard provides management with a high-level overview of performance trends and cashflow risk drivers.


## Key Insights

- Revenue performance remained stable across the reporting period.

- Revenue contribution was concentrated among a small number of products.

- Cashflow exposure was driven by a small group of customers with outstanding receivables.

## Conclusion

Revenue performance remained stable during the reporting period, with sales concentrated among a small number of products. While overall collection performance was strong, outstanding receivables indicate moderate cashflow exposure driven by a small group of customers.



## Recommendations

- Monitor outstanding receivables regularly through KPI tracking to reduce cashflow risk.

- Prioritize follow-up on customers contributing the highest unpaid balances.

- Maintain monthly revenue performance reporting to support forecasting and operational planning.

- Review product concentration risk to ensure revenue stability.
